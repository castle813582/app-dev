## Introduction

Hi there! Here are the list of my top 5 favorite series and movies, made with ~~boring~~ ==exciting== Markdown elements! 

## Top 5 Series/Movies Ranking

### 5. Band of Brothers ^[WWII Epic]^

> A groundbreaking miniseries that captures the raw essence of warfare and brotherhood, experienced by the finest "Easy" Company, 2nd Battalion, 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment of the 101st Airborne Division.

**Key Highlights:**
- Incredible historical accuracy/authenticity 
- Powerful character development
- Emotional depth
- There's Ross from Friends series

### 4. The Pacific

`A visceral portrayal of World War II's Pacific theater`

**Marine Experience Breakdown:**
1. Brutal combat scenarios
2. Personal soldier narratives
3. Humanity amidst chaos
4. Not for the faint of heart though.

What's the difference between this and Band of Brothers?
- The Pacific showcases that war is horrible better than the Band of Brothers since it mostly glamorizes the heroism of the named airborne forces of "Easy" Company.
- 

### 3. Better Call Saul

Exploring the fascinating transformation of Jimmy McGill! 

| Character | Evolution |
| --------- | --------- |
| Jimmy McGill | Aspiring Lawyer |

Favorite Quote: 
>  Walk away. That's right Howard. You know why I didn't take the job? **Because it's too small**! I don't care about it! It's nothing to me! It's a bacterium! I travel in worlds you can't even imagine! You can't conceive of what I'm capable of! I'm so far beyond you! I'm like a god in human clothing! Lighting bolts shoot from my fingertips!
